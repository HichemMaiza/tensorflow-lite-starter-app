# TFlite Starter App

## Goal

Illustrate the different steps to deploy a tensorflow deep learning model. this tuto is divided into tow parts

1. (The first part)[<https://github.com/deepKratos/tflite_starter_app/tree/master/learning_part>]

    * training the model => result : model.h5 
    * transforming into protobuff tensorflow graphFormat => result : model.pb
    * transforming into tflite format => result : model.tflite

2. (The second part)[<https://github.com/deepKratos/tflite_starter_app/tree/master/TFLiteDemo>]

    * build the android app
    * Compile tflite dependencies
    * Define input/output app shapes
    * Run inference
